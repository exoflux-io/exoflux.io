TERMS OF SERVICE Last Updated: [24.12.2025] Provider: Demet Solutions (Represented by Demet Kurt)

1. SCOPE OF SERVICES Demet Solutions provides bespoke automation architecture utilizing n8n workflows and custom-built HTML interfaces ("The Dashboard").
The service includes system design, integration of third-party APIs, and deployment documentation. This is a consultancy and implementation service;
it is not a pre-packaged software product.

2. DEPLOYMENT & HOSTING All automations are designed to be hosted by the Client (via VPS or n8n cloud subscription).
The HTML interface functions client-side and interacts with the Client’s infrastructure via secure webhooks.
Demet Solutions does not provide permanent hosting for the Client's data or workflows.

3. DATA PRIVACY & ACCESS CONTROL

Verification: Access to direct communication (Tawk.to) is gated by a unique Access Token generated upon acceptance of these terms.
This token is used solely for identity verification during the onboarding process.

Ephemeral Data: Any API keys or credentials provided for setup are stored in a secure, local environment during
the configuration phase and arepermanently deleted upon project delivery.

Third-Party Disclosure: Data processed through the automations may be transmitted to third-party AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
as per the project requirements. The Client acknowledges the privacy terms of these providers.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY Demet Solutions shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages,
including but not limited to financial loss, data loss, or account suspensions on third-party platforms (e.g., Instagram, Telegram)
resulting from the use of the automations. The Client assumes full responsibility for the operation of the delivered workflows.

5. PAYMENTS All transactions are secured via Escrow services to ensure bilateral protection. Fees for maintenance and custom updates are subject to separate agreements.


2. Privacy Policy & Data Handling

PRIVACY & DATA POLICY

1. DATA SOVEREIGNTY Demet Solutions operates on a "Zero-Retention" principle. Once the handover is complete, no Client data, API keys,
or proprietary workflows remain on the Provider’s systems.

2. THE "ACCESS TOKEN" SYSTEM To initiate high-priority support and chat, a unique alphanumeric token is generated.
This system allows Demet Solutions to verify the Client’s identity without collecting invasive metadata such as
IP addresses or device fingerprints, ensuring a privacy-first communication channel.

3. TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS During the development phase, data integrity is monitored via internal analysis tools to ensure no unauthorized
copying or manipulation occurs. Upon delivery, the Client is encouraged to rotate all API credentials for maximum security
